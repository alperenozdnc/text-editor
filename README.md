## txtedt

really simple text editor i made to start learning C.

### what i learned

this project helped me get ideas on:

- how to structure a C project,
- manual memory management,
- string manipulation,
- dealing with undefined behaviours (which i never used to deal with in high-level languages),
- how `make` can be utilized to increase project development,
- writing tests for C,
- pointers, references, deferences, structs, enums,
- reading the manuals more carefully,

and much more.
